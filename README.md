## Breezy Python GUI -- Basics

This repository contains a collection of simple programs that demonstrate how to create graphical user interfaces (GUIs) using BreezyPythonGUI in Python. Each program is designed to illustrate a particular aspect of GUI programming, such as creating buttons, input fields, and dialog boxes.

The programs are written in Python and use the BreezyPythonGUI library, which is a lightweight GUI toolkit for Python that is easy to use and learn.
